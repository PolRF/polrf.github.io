      <description>&lt;p&gt;At Aldara, we solve HOAs (homeowners&amp;rsquo; associations&amp;rsquo;) management at scale. One of our core services is customer support and task management for our clients, ranging from short-lived customer support tickets addressing owner financial petitions to long-term projects like constructions. Currently, over 80% of tasks are generated by our AI based on customer support conversations, and more than 70% of task actions are done with the help of our LLM pipelines. This AI-driven approach is what enables us to scale our operations while providing high-quality service to our clients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
